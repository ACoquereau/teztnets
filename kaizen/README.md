Tezos changes protocol every few months. By contrast, Tezos testnets have been recreated at each protocol  upgrade. **Kaizen** is a new kind of Tezos testnet that upgrades to closely follow Tezos mainnet protocol.

There is no democracy involved: Kaizen upgrades are user-activated. The upgrade blocks are centrally managed on the Teztnets.xyz platform.

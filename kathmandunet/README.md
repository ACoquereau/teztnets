Half-baked Kathmandu protocol snapshot. The real one will come later. PLEASE DO NOT INJECT.

There is no Octez release for this first instance of Kathmandunet. You need to build or grab a build or container from the master branch of Octez built on or after `Wed Jun 29 17:42:33 2022 +0000` (commit `43d54ff63d`).

But the protocol is already snapshotted. The baker binary for this protocol is `tezos-baker-014-PtKathma`. Do not run the "alpha" baker, it will not work.

We welcome bootstrap bakers for Limanet! The process is opt-in: please make yourself known in the baking slack, or make a Pull Request against the teztnets repo [Limanet definition](https://github.com/oxheadalpha/teztnets/blob/main/limanet/values.yaml) file.

For the first 8192 blocks, Limanet will run the Kathmandu protocol. Please start your Jakarta bakers.

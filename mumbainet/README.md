For the first 8192 blocks, Mumbainet will run the Lima protocol. Please start your Lima bakers.

Then Mumbainet will upgrade to `PtMumbai2TmsJHNGRkD8v8YDbtao7BLUC3wjASn1inAKLFCjaH1`. Instead of a user-activated upgrade, this will be a dictator upgrade using the testnet dictator key.

Once running Mumbai, Mumbainet will have 8 second blocks (twice faster than mainnet).

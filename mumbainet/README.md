We welcome bootstrap bakers for Mumbainet! The process is opt-in: please make yourself known in the baking slack, or make a Pull Request against the teztnets repo [Mumbainet definition](https://github.com/oxheadalpha/teztnets/blob/main/mumbainet/values.yaml) file.

For the first 8192 blocks, Mumbainet will run the Lima protocol. Please start your Lima bakers.

Once running Mumbai, Mumbainet will have 8 second blocks (twice faster than mainnet).

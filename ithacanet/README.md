⚠️  There are no released packages or binaries for this testnet. You must build from source or use Docker.

⚠️  Tenderbake has no endorser. The endorser binary does not exist. This is normal. Running the baker daemon is enough.

⚠️  You can not sign with Ledger for now. You need to use a hot wallet address.

### Report bugs

You are encouraged to run the baker in debug mode:

```
export TEZOS_LOG="* -> debug"
```

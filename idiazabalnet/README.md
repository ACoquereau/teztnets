ðŸ”¥ If you're here, this means you belong to one of the few lucky people to take part into the testnet using the brand new consensus algorithm [Tenderbake](https://blog.nomadic-labs.com/a-look-ahead-to-tenderbake.html). Congratulations and thanks in advance! This page shows you how to set up your system and actively participate in testing Tenderbake.

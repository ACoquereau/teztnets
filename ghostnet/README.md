Ghostnet is centrally managed to follow Tezos Mainnet protocol upgrades. It generally updates to the same protocol than Mainnet a few hours before Mainnet update itself.

Ghostnet was previously known as Ithacanet, the testchain for the Ithaca protocol.

Ghostnet indexers are available at:

* [TzStats](https://ghost.tzstats.com)
* [TzKT](https://ghostnet.tzkt.io)

If you were previously running an Ithacanet node and it is now stuck at upgrade level (765952), you must erase the node storage and restore from a snapshot from [XTZ-Shots](https://xtz-shots.io).
